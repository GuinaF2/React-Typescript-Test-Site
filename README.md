# [Project Name]

This guide provides instructions for the installation and execution of this project, built with the Vite development environment and the React library.

## âœ¨ Technologies Used

* **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development environment.
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** Vite requires Node.js to run. The latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version is recommended.
    To check if Node.js is installed, open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

* **NPM (Node Package Manager):** NPM is installed automatically with Node.js.
    To check your NPM version, run:
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
